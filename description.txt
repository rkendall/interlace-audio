Four Impromptus is a work of interactive art and music that empowers the listener to become artist, composer, and performer. The listener interacts with the work to create a kinetic visual geometry onscreen that doubles as a personal orchestra. A soundscape materializes as the listener combines and recombines short music utterances into endless different configurations. Timbre, sonic density, range, and interplay between sound and silence are all building blocks at the listener's disposal.

Each Impromptu represents a different time of day, and the installation defaults to present the piece corresponding to the current time.
